"""Agent tools.

The problem these solve: a LangChain tool can only return a *string* to the model, but
the UI needs structured citations — lesson id, Loom id, timestamp — to render an embedded
player. If we asked the model to repeat that data back to us in its answer it would
paraphrase, drop digits, and occasionally invent a timestamp.

So the tools do two things at once. They return readable text to the model, and they
record the exact metadata of every chunk they touched into a `CitationCollector`. After
the run, `agent.py` reads the collector. The model never handles a URL or a timestamp.

        # QUIZ FORMAT CONTRACT:
        # Keep this output format aligned with the frozen contract in
        # para-leer/SCHEMA.md. app/app.py parses this text to build the
        # interactive quiz and calculate the student's score.
        # The rules below exist because the first version produced technically-correct
        # but weak questions. Two failures in particular:
        #
        #   "What differentiates a router chain from a sequential chain?"
        #     A) Router chains can only handle one input at a time
        #     B) Router chains are used for making decisions based on conditions
        #     ...
        #   Every option describes router chains only, so the comparison the stem
        #   promises is never actually tested.
        #
        #   "What is the primary focus of the course excerpt regarding R-squared?"
        #   A question about the excerpt rather than about the subject.
        #
        #   "How many chains can theoretically be concatenated in LangChain?"  -> "100"
        #   A number said in passing, turned into a fact. "Unlimited" is arguably the
        #   better answer, and the student learns nothing either way.
        #
        #   "What happens when you run a sequential chain with the topic 'tennis'?"
        #   Tests whether you watched the demo that happened to use the word tennis.
        #   The mechanism is the point; the example topic is noise.

            f"Using ONLY the course excerpts below, write {num_questions} multiple-choice "
            f"quiz questions about '{topic}'.\n\n"
            "Rules for the questions:\n"
            "- Ask about the SUBJECT, never about the material. Never write 'according "
            "to the excerpt', 'in this lesson', or 'what does the course say about'. The "
            "student is being tested on the concept, not on the transcript.\n"
            "- If a question compares two things, the options MUST distinguish between "
            "them — each option should say something about both, or contrast them "
            "directly. An option that only describes one of the two cannot test the "
            "comparison, which makes the question answerable without understanding it.\n"
            "- Vary what you ask: what something is, what it is for, when to choose it "
            "over an alternative, what happens if it is missing or misused.\n"
            "- Ask about the CONCEPT, never about the incidental details of a demo. "
            "The excerpts are lecture transcripts, so they are full of specifics that "
            "carry no understanding: the example topic the instructor typed, a variable "
            "name, a file name, which dataset was loaded. If a question can only be "
            "answered by having watched that exact demo, it is the wrong question — ask "
            "about the mechanism the demo was illustrating instead.\n"
            "- Never ask for a number, a count, a limit or a version unless the number "
            "is itself something the course teaches. A figure said once in passing is "
            "not a fact worth testing, and guessing one is worse.\n"
            "- If the excerpts do not state something explicitly and unambiguously, do "
            "not ask about it. Prefer a question you can point at a sentence for.\n\n"
            "Rules for the options:\n"
            "- Exactly four, labelled A-D, exactly one correct.\n"
            "- All four must be the same KIND of statement and roughly the same length. "
            "A single longer, more detailed option gives the answer away.\n"
            "- Wrong options must be plausible to someone who half-remembers the "
            "material — a real concept applied to the wrong thing, or a common "
            "misunderstanding. Never absurd, never obviously off-topic, never a "
            "filler like 'none of the above'.\n"
            "- Vary which letter is correct across the quiz. Left to itself the model "
            "puts the right answer at B nearly every time, which a student can game "
            "without knowing anything.\n"
            "- Base every question and every option strictly on the excerpts. Never "
            "invent a fact that is not in them. If the excerpts do not support four "
            "distinct plausible options, ask a simpler question that they do support.\n\n"
            "Format each question exactly as:\n\n"
            "<question>\nA) ...\nB) ...\nC) ...\nD) ...\nAnswer: <letter>\n\n"
