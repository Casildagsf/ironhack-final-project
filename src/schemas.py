"""The two contracts from para-leer/SCHEMA.md, as code.

Both parsers build chunks through the helpers here rather than hand-writing dicts, so
Casilda's VTT parser and Felipe's notebook parser cannot drift apart. The agent builds
citations through `build_citation`, so the UI never has to know that Loom wants `?t=872s`
and silently ignores `?t=872`.

If you need to change something in here, change para-leer/SCHEMA.md first and tell the
other person. A silent change breaks the other side and surfaces days later.
